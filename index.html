				printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
				mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
				store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
